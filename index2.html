      <h2>🌐 Spotlight Topic: Phishing Scams</h2>
      <p><strong>What is Phishing?</strong> Phishing is when attackers trick you into sharing sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers) by pretending to be a trustworthy source, like your bank or a well-known company.</p>
      <h3>How to Spot a Phishing Attempt:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Suspicious URLs:</strong> Hover over links before clicking. Is the web address slightly off (e.g., "amaz0n.com")?</li>
        <li><strong>Urgent Language:</strong> "Act now or lose access!"—legitimate companies rarely use scare tactics.</li>
        <li><strong>Generic Greetings:</strong> Emails like "Dear User" instead of your name could be a red flag.</li>
        <li><strong>Unexpected Attachments:</strong> Don’t open files unless you trust the sender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What to Do:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delete suspicious emails or messages.</li>
        <li>Use a password manager to avoid reusing passwords.</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra security.</li>
      </ul>
